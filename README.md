## Description of the project

In the MyReads project, create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you're currently reading or want to read, have read, and add books from your book library to your bookshelf

The project emphasizes the use of React to build applications and provides an API server and client library that you will use to hold information as you interact with the application.
